# arduino-morse-blinker

#### Hey everyone!

This is my first repo (that I wasn't instructed to make as part of an assignment).

It's also my first time using the command line to push locally edited files to [github](https://github.com). 

*And* it's my first time creating a markdown file (though for someone who grew up on the internet, it seems very intuitive).

That's a whole lot of firsts!

#### What's in this repo?

I've written a program for the Arduino Uno that blinks messages in morse code on a single LED!
