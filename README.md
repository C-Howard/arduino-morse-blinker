# arduino-morse-blinker

#### Hey everyone!

This is my first repo (that I wasn't instructed to make as part of an assignment).

It's also my first time using the command line to push locally edited files to [github](https://github.com). 

*And* it's my first time creating a markdown file!

That's a whole lot of firsts!

#### What's in this repo?

I've written a program for the Arduino Uno that blinks a message in morse code on a single LED!

#### To Use:

Set up an circuit using a DIGITAL OUT pin on your Arduino to power a single LED.

Set 'outPin' to whichever pin you've used.

Edit the 'message' array to contain your own message! Be sure to follow character restrictions and update 'maxLength' if your message exceeds it!

Upload the sketch to your board.

Watch the magic happen!
